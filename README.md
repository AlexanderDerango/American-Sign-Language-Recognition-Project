🤟 ASL Hand Sign Recognition (A–E)
This project implements a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) hand sign recognition system for the letters A to E using deep learning and computer vision. It uses a trained CNN model to classify ASL hand gestures from a webcam feed, powered by TensorFlow, OpenCV, and MediaPipe.

🚀 Project Structure
asl_model.h5 – Trained TensorFlow model for classifying ASL letters A–E.
asl_demo.py – Live webcam-based ASL detection and classification script.
asl_dataset/ – Dataset folder with training images of ASL hand signs.
training_script.py – Script used to train and validate the CNN model.
requirements.txt – Python dependencies.
🧠 Model Training
Dataset: ASL Alphabet dataset (A–E subset).
Image Size: 224x224 for MobileNet compatibility.
Preprocessing:
Rescaling and normalization.
Data augmentation (rotation, zoom, shifts, horizontal flip).
Model: Transfer learning using MobileNetV2 + custom dense layers.
Evaluation: Achieved high accuracy on validation data.
